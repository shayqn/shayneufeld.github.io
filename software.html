                <h3>the IDEAS platform (SaaS)</h3>
                <p>My Inscopix team of talented software engineers and computational scientists built (and continues to build) the Inscopix Data Exploration, Analysis, and Sharing (IDEAS) cloud platform.
                    IDEAS is made for organizing and large large calcium imaging and behavior datasets (we are working on expanding to other data modalities!). </p>
                <p>The overarching goal of IDEAS is to abstract away a lot of the database + data engineering required to responsibly and reproducibly process 
                terabytes of imaging data into insights about how neural activity gives rise to behavior. We want scientists to focus on asking the right questions, collecting the right data, and interpreting the results - 
                without needing to be software developers, site reliability engineers, cloud computing maestros, and Python-dependency snake charmers all at the same time. </p>
                <p> In addition to offering Inscopix's own algorithms for processing and analyzing miniscope & behavior data, IDEAS also hosts popular open source packages like DeepLabCut, suite2P, and CaImAn so 
                    researchers can more easily use these cutting edge methods without studying for a CS degree on the side.
                </p>
                <p>Since commercially launching in 2023, IDEAS users have uploaded & generated over 50 terabytes of data, and successfully executed over 15000 analysis tasks! </p>
